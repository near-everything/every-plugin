description: Advanced patterns and examples for every-plugin
---

This guide provides advanced patterns and real-world examples for building sophisticated plugins with every-plugin. Each recipe is self-contained and focuses on specific capabilities.

## Core Patterns

These recipes highlight every-plugin's unique features for real-time communication and scaling.

## Key Concepts

### MemoryPublisher vs Queues

| Pattern | Use Case | Semantics | Example |
|---------|---------|-----------|---------|
| **MemoryPublisher** | Broadcasting events to multiple clients | Pub/sub - all subscribers get events | Real-time notifications, activity feeds |
| **Queue** | Distributing work to workers | Work distribution - each task processed once | Job processing, task queues |

### Event Streaming Features

- **Resume Support**: Use `lastEventId` to resume streams after disconnections
- **Broadcast Semantics**: All subscribers receive the same events
- **Metadata Access**: Use `getEventMeta()` for debugging and monitoring
- **Serverless Ready**: Automatic timeout handling with resume capabilities

### Scaling Options

- **MemoryPublisher**: In-memory for single instance, development
- **IORedisPublisher**: Redis-backed for multi-instance production
- **Namespace Isolation**: Avoid conflicts between different plugins
